### DOM Manipulation
DOM stands for Document Object Model, it is a structured representation of an HTML document, DOM is used to connect webpages to scripts like JS.

For each HTML box, there is an object in the DOM that we can access and interact with.

The HTML content is stored in the DObjectM and can be access and manipulated by its object methods using JS

### Game rules

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
